Hi,

INSTRUCTIONS:

To do an action in game, type in the name of the action by itself. Then you can select one of the targets to do the action on. 
Type help in game to find out what actions are possible.


For this limited demo of my game it is recommended that you take this path to see all the features.

1. Select Hotel of Doom
2. Start a new campaign
3. Look around
4. Talk to the manager, and choose options 3 - 2 - 2
5. Pick Up the mjollnir weapon
6. View Inventory 
7. Choose mjollnir then press Y to equip it
8. Move through the shady doorway
9. Look around
10. Save
11. Fight the angry man
12. That's pretty much it for the demo!
